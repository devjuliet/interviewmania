# Detect panagram

## Description
A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return `true` if it is, `false` if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

## Examples
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."              =>  `true`

"This is not a pangram."          =>  `false`

""               =>  `false`

"What do you count"  =>  `false`

## Constraints
Case is irrelevant.

## Complete the algorithm
```javascript
function isPangram(string){
  //...
}
```
